[Pointless](202104111309), 2021

# My task was to follow 86,400 one-bit instructions, randomly generated by a computer at a rate of one per second.

[Using a marker on a sheet of paper](202105291101), I had to either paint or leave it blank according to the computer’s commands (yes or no), minimizing pauses to only what was strictly necessary.

If I lost my attention during the process, I had to stop the instructions, mark in red, and once I was ready to continue, start the instructions again.

[At a rate of one instruction per second](202105311723), [each sheet theoretically represented one hour](202105291511). Completing [24 sheets](202105271855) would amount [86400 instructions](202105291803). 

This performance serves as [an experiment to test the limits of my own attention](202105291750). The absurdity of the task, its challenge-based design, and the chosen narrative and visual language all come together as a playground to explore our understanding of attention —its value and its role in today’s digital society.

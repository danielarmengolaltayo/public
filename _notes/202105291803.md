>â†‘ Every second of [the performance](202105291521) in a single image.

This image precisely captures, down to the second, the recorded instructions, the moments when I lost my attention, and the pauses between sheets. 

**The performance lasted a total of 47 hours, 55 minutes, and 34 seconds**, meaning that the average time per sheet was nearly two hours, twice [the theoretical minimum](202105291511).

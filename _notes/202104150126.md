[I Am a Strange Loop](202103150108), 2017

A mirror mirroring a mirror. A selfie as a projection of the self. Artificial intelligence proficient at recognizing its surroundings, capable of learning and even dreaming. Psychedelia.

# An interface, deeply immersed in self-observation, lost in an apparent spiral of vanity, posing and taking selfies endlessly, trapped into a strange loop of technological introspection. 

A visual loop that we can intervene to become part of an altered state in search of consciousness and the meaning of the self.

>The effect used in this piece is called [video feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_feedback), and Douglas Hofstadter discusses it in his book [I Am a Strange Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Strange_Loop) about the human mind and consciousness.

title: "Pointless / Attention understood as a scarce resource"

[Pointless](202104111309), 2021

We live in an era dominated by a new medium that demands new forms of interaction and communication. A medium that imposes such an accelerated pace that it barely leaves us room to breathe, digest, or reflect. In this scenario, it seems that absurdity has become the guiding principle that drives us, and only those who push it to the extreme —capturing the greatest number of eyes and ears— will have the opportunity to influence the behavior of society as a whole.

This was my proposal for extreme absurdity: [I tried to capture my full attention by following random instructions every second for 24 hours](202105291521). **Because, if attention is a limited resource that can be exploited, where exactly does its limit lie?**
 
Attention has become a valuable asset —it can be captured, measured, and profiled, then used to target and trigger specific behaviors in us. I harvested my own attention so that [you could buy it later](202105271855), in a carefully designed spectacle meant to seize yours, with the ultimate goal of asking you one question: 

# Do you think it is possible to regain some agency over the flows of our own attention?

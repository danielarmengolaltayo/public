>*“Usage of the term (Iterative and incremental development) began in software development, […] having been widely suggested for large development efforts. […] The basic idea behind this method is to develop a system through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental), allowing software developers to take advantage of what was learned during development of earlier parts or versions of the system. Learning comes from both the development and use of the system, where possible key steps in the process start with a simple implementation of a subset of the software requirements and iteratively enhance the evolving versions until the full system is implemented. **At each iteration, design modifications are made and new functional capabilities are added.**”*

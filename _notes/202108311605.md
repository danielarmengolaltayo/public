# [This website is an experiment](202103120016), a sandbox where I can play with my thoughts and export them to the world. 

Although the website can be accessed from any device, the design of the experience is primarily intended for the desktop, and optimized for my personal use. It plays with explicit [bidirectional links](202108271846) between internal pages and a generous preview, which added to [the keyboard navigation using the browser shortcuts](202108291255), allows me a very fast interaction.

The content is stored in Markdown files, the format I use to take notes, not only for practical reasons such as centralizing the content in one place or standardizing the formats to work with, but as an exercise to consolidate my note-taking system as well as to test it as a system to communicate and share ideas with others effectively.

> [The website is built from a template](202108311708), and [the code is public](https://github.com/danielarmengolaltayo/a-a), but it's a mess. Write me if you want to comment anything.

> The design is influenced by [the template itself](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template), and highly inspired by [Ted Nelson's ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMKy52Intac) and [Andy Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), as well as many other sources I cannot recall, and therefore, accredit.

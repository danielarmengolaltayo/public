>â†‘ Empty grid on the left, grid filled with [random one-bit instructions](202105291521) on the right.

The sheet of paper featured a dot grid of 50 columns by 72 rows (50 x 72 = 3600). Since the grid had to be filled at a rate of one instruction per second, **each sheet was the equivalent of one hour** (1 hour = 3600 seconds).
